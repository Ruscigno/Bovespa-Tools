#Bovespa Tools

Small tools for small trades of [BM&F Bovespa](http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/).

##Introduction

If we compare the American Stock Exchange under the Brazilian we will notice a huge difference, either by financial volume or by the number of investors. In fact this comparison is not fair, since we are comparing a first world country with an emerging one.

The fact is that the number of small American investors, that is the householder who invest part of their savings in stocks to get better results than it would have if he left his money in the bank, is much larger than the number of Brazilian investors. Additionally, the number of tools available for this little American investor to make his decision to buy or sell in the best possible way is much bigger and with more quality than those of Brazilians investors have.

The main difficulty of the Brazilian investor faces is the difficulty of finding a reliable database with all current assets of [BM&F Bovespa](http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/), that is, it is not easy to find a quality database, updated and free. You can argue that [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/) or [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance) offer this option. Yes, both Yahoo and Google do offer good tools for decision making, however, try to compare the two databases, take an symbol and compare its price history between the two databases, you will notice a variation in prices, sometimes a huge one. Then you could wonder why there is this difference!?
> 1. Stock Split and Merge
> 2. Stock Dividends

However the biggest problem is how to have a reliable database that you can use in technical analysis programs such as [MetaStock](http://www.metastock.com/) ou o [Metatrader](http://www.metatrader5.com/), this is where things start to get worse, because an free updated database with more than 5 years of history is not easy to find and this will negatively impact your decision making.

##Goals

1. Provide a free and reliable Bovespa's database for the small investor, that is, provide a tool that will allows you to create this database according to your needs.
2. Provide tools that will help you in decision making, and I'm not referring to a complete technical analysis tool, but of small utilities that will perform automated tasks as the symbol's price alert via email or SMS.

Finally, in a second moment to publish a website where these tools will be available as well as a blog with stock's buys and sell triggered by these tools.
