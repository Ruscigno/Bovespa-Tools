#Bovespa Tools

Small tools for small trades of [BM&F Bovespa](http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/).

##Introduction

If we compare the American Stock Exchange and Brazilian's one we will notice a huge difference, either by financial volume or by the number of investors. In fact this comparison is not fair, since we are comparing a first world country with an emerging one.

The fact is that the number of small American investors (I mean, the householder who invest part of their savings in stocks to get better results than it would have if he left his money in the bank) is much larger than the number of Brazilian investors. Additionally, the number of tools available for this small American investor to make his decisions in the best possible way is much bigger and with more quality than those of Brazilians investors have.

The main difficulty of the Brazilian investor faces is the difficulty of finding a reliable [BM&F Bovespa's](http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/) stock database, that is, it is not easy to find a quality, updated and free Bovespa's stock database. You can argue that [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/) or [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance) offer this history. Yes, both Yahoo and Google do offer good tools for decision making, however, try to compare the two databases, take an stock and compare its price history between the two databases, you will notice a variation in prices, sometimes a huge one. Then you could wonder why there is this difference!? Two main reasons:
> 1. Stock Split and Merge
> 2. Stock Dividends

So the biggest problem is how to have a reliable database that you can use in technical analysis programs such as [MetaStock](http://www.metastock.com/) or [Metatrader](http://www.metatrader5.com/)? This is where things start to get worse. As I said, a free and updated database with more than 5 years of history is not easy to find so this will negatively impact your decision making.

And this is where this project idea born.

##Goals

1. Provide a free and reliable Bovespa's database for the Bovespa's small investor, that is, provide a tool that will allows you to create this database according to your needs.
2. Provide tools that will help you in the decision making process, and I'm not referring to a complete technical analysis tool, but to small utilities that will perform automated tasks as sotck price alert trigered via email or SMS.
3. Provide a website where these tools will be available as well as a blog with all buys and sells triggered by these tools.
